# Cobalt

## Status
Cobalt is still currently working and is able to dodge games, there is around 1,000 users that use cobalt and it seems to be working flawlessly!

## Download?
Download the launcher from my [website](https://steele.gg/tools/cobalt)

## Features
* Free ARAM boost
* Free lobby dodging (no lp loss or timer)
* Small file size and insanely fast

## How To Build the Tool
cargo build --bin cobalt --release

if you want to build the launcher for whatever reason you can also run

cargo build --bin cobalt-launcher --release

## Project Hierarchy
The tool directory is the tool itself, the launcher is what manages automatically updating the tool by downloading a compressed .xz file from my websites server. You can boot the tool up successfully by itself without the launcher but you will not get any automatic updates.
