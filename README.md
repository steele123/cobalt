# Cobalt

Cobalt is a free tool that dodges the league of legends lobbies and doesn't cost you any LP at all to use.

## Always free :)

I do not believe in charging for tools like this so I will never charge you a dime for this.

## TODO
* Add a proper UI instead a terminal window
* Add some more features to it other than just two
* Analyze league champ select lobby

### Features
* Free ARAM boost
* Free lobby dodge (no lp loss or timer)
* Small, yet insanely good performance
