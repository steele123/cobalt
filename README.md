# Cobalt

## How To Use
Download the launcher from my [website](https://steele.gg/tools/cobalt)

Build With Cargo cargo build --bin cobalt --release

Download from the releases tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/steele123/cobalt/releases)

## Project Hierarchy
The tool directory is the tool itself, the launcher is what manages automatically updating the tool by downloading a compressed .xz file from my websites server. You can boot the tool up successfully by itself without the launcher but you will not get any automatic updates.

## Features
* Free ARAM boost
* Free lobby dodging (no lp loss or timer)
* Small file size and insanely fast
